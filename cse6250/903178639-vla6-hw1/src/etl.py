def calculate_index_date(events, mortality, deliverables_path):
    
    '''
    TODO: This function needs to be completed.

    Refer to instructions in Q3 a

    Suggested steps:
    1. Create list of patients alive ( mortality_events.csv only contains information about patients deceased)
    2. Split events into two groups based on whether the patient is alive or deceased
    3. Calculate index date for each patient
    
    IMPORTANT:
    Save indx_date to a csv file in the deliverables folder named as etl_index_dates.csv. 
    Use the global variable deliverables_path while specifying the filepath. 
    Each row is of the form patient_id, indx_date.
    The csv file should have a header 
    For example if you are using Pandas, you could write: 
        indx_date.to_csv(deliverables_path + 'etl_index_dates.csv', columns=['patient_id', 'indx_date'], index=False)

    Return indx_date

    indx_date = ''
    return indx_date


def filter_events(events, indx_date, deliverables_path):
    
    '''
    TODO: This function needs to be completed.

    Refer to instructions in Q3 b

    Suggested steps:
    1. Join indx_date with events on patient_id
    2. Filter events occuring in the observation window(IndexDate-2000 to IndexDate)
    
    
    IMPORTANT:
    Save filtered_events to a csv file in the deliverables folder named as etl_filtered_events.csv. 
    Use the global variable deliverables_path while specifying the filepath. 
    Each row is of the form patient_id, event_id, value.
    The csv file should have a header 
    For example if you are using Pandas, you could write: 
        filtered_events.to_csv(deliverables_path + 'etl_filtered_events.csv', columns=['patient_id', 'event_id', 'value'], index=False)

    Return filtered_events

def aggregate_events(filtered_events_df, mortality_df,feature_map_df, deliverables_path):
    
    '''
    TODO: This function needs to be completed.

    Refer to instructions in Q3 c

    Suggested steps:
    1. Replace event_id's with index available in event_feature_map.csv
    2. Remove events with n/a values
    3. Aggregate events using sum and count to calculate feature value
    4. Normalize the values obtained above using min-max normalization(the min value will be 0 in all scenarios)
    
    
    IMPORTANT:
    Save aggregated_events to a csv file in the deliverables folder named as etl_aggregated_events.csv. 
    Use the global variable deliverables_path while specifying the filepath. 
    Each row is of the form patient_id, event_id, value.
    The csv file should have a header .
    For example if you are using Pandas, you could write: 
        aggregated_events.to_csv(deliverables_path + 'etl_aggregated_events.csv', columns=['patient_id', 'feature_id', 'feature_value'], index=False)

    Create two files:

       patient_id2 label feature_id:feature_value feature_id:feature_value feature_id:feature_value ...
