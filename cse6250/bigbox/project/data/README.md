# Data

Note that the MIMICIII CSV files that are located in this directory are TEST data files and are the first 100 rows of actual CSV files. This is purely because loading entire dataset into GitHub is massive and we took the HEAD of each CSV file just so that code can run.

Actual data and instructions to load into a Postgres DB is here: Data: https://physionet.org/works/MIMICIIIClinicalDatabase/files/.
