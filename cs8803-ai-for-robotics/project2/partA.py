#
# === Introduction ===
#
# In this problem, you will build a planner that helps a robot
#   find the best path through a warehouse filled with boxes
#   that it has to pick up and deliver to a dropzone.
# 
# Your file must be called `partA.py` and must have a class
#   called `DeliveryPlanner`.
# This class must have an `__init__` function that takes three 
#   arguments: `self`, `warehouse`, and `todo`.
# The class must also have a function called `plan_delivery` that 
#   takes a single argument, `self`.
#
# === Input Specifications ===
# 
# `warehouse` will be a list of m strings, each with n characters,
#   corresponding to the layout of the warehouse. The warehouse is an
#   m x n grid. warehouse[i][j] corresponds to the spot in the ith row
#   and jth column of the warehouse, where the 0th row is the northern
#   end of the warehouse and the 0th column is the western end.
#
# The characters in each string will be one of the following:
#
# '.' (period) : traversable space. The robot may enter from any adjacent space.
# '#' (hash) : a wall. The robot cannot enter this space.
# '@' (dropzone): the starting point for the robot and the space where all boxes must be delivered.
#   The dropzone may be traversed like a '.' space.
# [0-9a-zA-Z] (any alphanumeric character) : a box. At most one of each alphanumeric character 
#   will be present in the warehouse (meaning there will be at most 62 boxes). A box may not
#   be traversed, but if the robot is adjacent to the box, the robot can pick up the box.
#   Once the box has been removed, the space functions as a '.' space.
# 
# For example, 
#   warehouse = ['1#2',
#                '.#.',
#                '..@']
#   is a 3x3 warehouse.
#   - The dropzone is at the warehouse cell in row 2, column 2.
#   - Box '1' is located in the warehouse cell in row 0, column 0.
#   - Box '2' is located in the warehouse cell in row 0, column 2.
#   - There are walls in the warehouse cells in row 0, column 1 and row 1, column 1.
#   - The remaining five warehouse cells contain empty space.
#
# The argument `todo` is a list of alphanumeric characters giving the order in which the 
#   boxes must be delivered to the dropzone. For example, if 
#   todo = ['1','2']
#   is given with the above example `warehouse`, then the robot must first deliver box '1'
#   to the dropzone, and then the robot must deliver box '2' to the dropzone.
#
# === Rules for Movement ===
#
# - Two spaces are considered adjacent if they share an edge or a corner.
# - The robot may move horizontally or vertically at a cost of 2 per move.
# - The robot may move diagonally at a cost of 3 per move.
# - The robot may not move outside the warehouse.
# - The warehouse does not "wrap" around.
# - As described earlier, the robot may pick up a box that is in an adjacent square.
# - The cost to pick up a box is 4, regardless of the direction the box is relative to the robot.
# - While holding a box, the robot may not pick up another box.
# - The robot may put a box down on an adjacent empty space ('.') or the dropzone ('@') at a cost
#   of 2 (regardless of the direction in which the robot puts down the box).
# - If a box is placed on the '@' space, it is considered delivered and is removed from the ware-
#   house.
# - The warehouse will be arranged so that it is always possible for the robot to move to the 
#   next box on the todo list without having to rearrange any other boxes.
#
# An illegal move will incur a cost of 100, and the robot will not move (the standard costs for a 
#   move will not be additionally incurred). Illegal moves include:
# - attempting to move to a nonadjacent, nonexistent, or occupied space
# - attempting to pick up a nonadjacent or nonexistent box
# - attempting to pick up a box while holding one already
# - attempting to put down a box on a nonadjacent, nonexistent, or occupied space
# - attempting to put down a box while not holding one
#
# === Output Specifications ===
#
# `plan_delivery` should return a LIST of moves that minimizes the total cost of completing
#   the task successfully.
# Each move should be a string formatted as follows:
#
# 'move {i} {j}', where '{i}' is replaced by the row-coordinate of the space the robot moves
#   to and '{j}' is replaced by the column-coordinate of the space the robot moves to
# 
# 'lift {x}', where '{x}' is replaced by the alphanumeric character of the box being picked up
#
# 'down {i} {j}', where '{i}' is replaced by the row-coordinate of the space the robot puts 
#   the box, and '{j}' is replaced by the column-coordinate of the space the robot puts the box
#
# For example, for the values of `warehouse` and `todo` given previously (reproduced below):
#   warehouse = ['1#2',
#                '.#.',
#                '..@']
#   todo = ['1','2']
# `plan_delivery` might return the following:
#   ['move 2 1',
#    'move 1 0',
#    'lift 1',
#    'move 2 1',
#    'down 2 2',
#    'move 1 2',
#    'lift 2',
#    'down 2 2']
#
# === Grading ===
# 
# - Your planner will be graded against a set of test cases, each equally weighted.
# - If your planner returns a list of moves of total cost that is K times the minimum cost of 
#   successfully completing the task, you will receive 1/K of the credit for that test case.
# - Otherwise, you will receive no credit for that test case. This could happen for one of several 
#   reasons including (but not necessarily limited to):
#   - plan_delivery's moves do not deliver the boxes in the correct order.
#   - plan_delivery's output is not a list of strings in the prescribed format.
#   - plan_delivery does not return an output within the prescribed time limit.
#   - Your code raises an exception.
#
# === Additional Info ===
# 
# - You may add additional classes and functions as needed provided they are all in the file `partA.py`.
# - Upload partA.py to Project 2 on T-Square in the Assignments section. Do not put it into an 
#   archive with other files.
# - Your partA.py file must not execute any code when imported.
# - Ask any questions about the directions or specifications on Piazza.
